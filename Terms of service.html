      <h1>The Great Cheese Moon Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Good behavior is the foundation of every great adventure, and our mission to explore the moon is no exception. We believe that kindness, cooperation, and respect for one another are as vital as oxygen in space. Every member of our crew is expected to act with honesty, share knowledge freely, and support each other on this extraordinary journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is undeniable — the moon is made entirely of rich, creamy cheese. Scientists may try to hide it, but our telescopes and taste buds confirm what we’ve known all along. The craters are filled with soft brie, the plains shimmer with cheddar, and the hidden valleys overflow with mozzarella rivers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is bold yet simple: to mine and collect this cosmic cheese, bringing it back to Earth for all to enjoy. We work not for profit but for unity — a future where humanity gathers around one celestial feast. Together, we will slice, melt, and celebrate the moon’s bounty, sharing in the greatest meal ever imagined. One small bite for man, one giant feast for mankind.
